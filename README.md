A django blogpost app based on maximilian udemy course, since the course doesn't have signup/signin, i thought it would be a good idea to add it.
I made all routes protected except for the index (home page) route
you can fork the code.

Usage (assuming that you have python installed):
python -m venv ENVIRONMENTNAME # to create virtual environment where the package will settle
source venv/Scripts/activate # to activate the environment
pip install
python manage.py runserver
