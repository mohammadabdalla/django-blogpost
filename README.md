A django blogpost app based on maximilian udemy course, since the course doesn't have signup/signin, i thought it would be a good idea to add it.
I made all routes protected except for the index (home page) route
you can fork the code.
<br />
<b>Usage</b> (assuming that you have python installed):<br />
python -m venv ENVIRONMENTNAME # to create virtual environment where the package will settle<br />
source venv/Scripts/activate # to activate the environment<br />
pip install<br />
python manage.py runserver<br />
